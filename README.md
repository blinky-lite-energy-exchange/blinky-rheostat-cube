# Blinky Rheostat Cube
The Blinky Rheostat Cube is a stepper motor drive that is designed to drive 12V bi-polar stepper motors using the high current [DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Carrier](https://www.pololu.com/product/2133). The DRV8825 is driven by a [Teensy LC](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html) micro-controller. The Teensy LC micro-controller communicates to the [Blinky Rheostat tray](https://github.com/blinky-lite-energy-exchange/blinky-rheostat-tray) with a serial Bluetooth connection very similar to the connection method described in the [Blinky Bus Cube](https://github.com/Blinky-Lite-Exchange/blinky-bus-cube) project.
